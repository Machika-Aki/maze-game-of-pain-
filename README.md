# maze-game-of-pain

I initially made it without making a bunch of global variables, and after i finished fixing about 30-something errors, the movement for the player (purple brick) just stopped working. Pls help me.

UPDATE: I... I feel so dumb rn. All I had to do was reuse my original game loop up to the part of the game that draws everything. AUUUGHHHHH
